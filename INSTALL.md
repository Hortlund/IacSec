> To get the results for a few test scripts it takes *0.04 minutes to complete*. run `python main.py -t`. This command will execute SLIC for the test scripts. Upon completion of the analysis `Dumped CSV output file of 1197 bytes`, `Dumped symbolic output PICKLE of 6 bytes`, and `Duration: 0.0453675349553 minutes` will be displayed, which indicates that SLIC's execution is complete. 


> To get the results for the Mozilla repositories it takes *251 minutes to complete*. Follow steps 6-8: 
6. run `python main.py -m`. This command will execute SLIC for the scripts collected from the Mozilla repositories. Upon completion of the analysis `Dumped CSV output file of XXX bytes`, `Dumped symbolic output PICKLE of XXX bytes`, and `Ended at:XXX` will be displayed, which indicates that SLIC's execution is complete and it generated the result files used to answer RQ2 and RQ3. 
7. run `cd /SecurityInIaC/IacSec/analysis/`
8. run `python frq_cnt.py -m`. Upon execution the results of RQ2 will be obtained. Compare obtained results with the results presented in Table VIII of the paper. The results that correspond to the month 2018-06, correspond to the results presented in the paper.  


> To get the results for the Openstack repositories it takes *725 minutes to complete*. Follow steps 6-8:
6. run `python main.py -o`. This command will execute SLIC for the scripts collected from the Openstack repositories.
