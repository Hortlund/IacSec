Introduction

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You have the right to be a part of this study, to choose not to participate or to stop participating any time without penalty. We estimate that this study will take around 150~180 minutes. We anticipate minimal risks associated with participation. However, if you experience any discomfort or choose to stop taking the study for any reason, you may leave the study at any time. We do not anticipate any direct benefits to you for participating in this study. You will not be awarded credit if you do not complete the study. If you do not participate in the study or complete the study, you will still be able to get the same amount of credit from another extra homework. The extra homework will be of same time and effort. In this assignment you will be looking at messages and categorizing these messages into defect categories. You will be using two handbooks: one on Chef and one on Puppet. Participation in the exercise is voluntary and will not effect your grades or class standing.
